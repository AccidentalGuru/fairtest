%\heading{Motivation.}
%Modern data driven web applications offer enormous capabilities for data
%exchange and usage,
%but there is a strong need for transparency and accountability.
%All the more, highly sensitive personal information are being used from web
%applications to enhance user experience and help create efficient advertising
%policies. Unfortunately, the privacy implications of using that information are
%poorly understood and rarely studied due to lack of transparency and
%accountability. Consequently, there is a clear danger of unintentional data
%misuse, such as algorithmic discriminations. An indicative recent
%example is the Staples price discrimination case~\cite{Staples}.
%In this case an arguably reasonable algorithmic decision to optimize online
%prices based on user proximity to competitor brick-and-mortar locations led to
%consistently higher prices for low-income populations, since they tend to
%generally live farther from these stores. This kind of indirect--and likely
%unintended--effects are challenging to identify, and with the use of sensitive
%information collected by web applications, the risk for these dangers is only
%increasing. Thus, we believe that new programming tools are needed to increase
%developersâ€™ visibility into the data they collect and the implications of its
%integration into applications.
%
%\heading{Goals.}
%Our purpose is to build \thetool: A discrimination testing suite uncovering
%differential treatment of various populations based on protected
%attributes, such as religion, sexual orientation, or income. Our idea is to
%measure correlation between outputs of a specific program (such as a price
%recommendation engine) and the values of the protected attributes. Any strong
%correlation between protected attributes and outputs is threated as a privacy
%bug and is reported to the
%developer as potential discrimination. To provide a better perspective to the
%programmer, we will try to develop meaningful heuristics that rank observed
%correlations based on their likelihood to be unintended or unfair
%discriminations versus natural, preference-based effects. We will design
%{\it FairTest} to be easy to use by regular application programmers,
%will integrate
%it into popular testing frameworks, and write a set of sample applications
%indicating meaningful use cases.
%
%\heading{Expected Conclusions.}
%By using \thetool a developer will be able to test an application for
%discrimination cases by uncovering correlations between protected attributes
%and outputs. We expect to be able to identify clear cut discrimination cases,
%as well as previously unknown obscure discrimination cases. \thetool should
%work independently from the backend algorithms used for recomendations,
%and it should feature a
%simple API allowing developers easily test their code for privacy bugs.

%%\heading{Research Plan.}
%%The first milestone is to build a demonstrating scenario for the Staple
%%case~\cite{Staples} no later than the project status presentation date, on 3/10.
%%This will include a demo set of users created by tuning yelp's publicly
%%available data set~\cite{Yelp} to resemble Staple's user set, and a list of
%%random competitor addresses. Then, we will build a sample application
%%recommending product prices based on user and competitor locality.
%%The second milestone is to build the necessary infrastructure to identify and
%%rank correlations between user attributes, such as address, sex, and age, with
%%outputs, such as price. The third milestone is the design of \thetool's API
%%for writing tests to rank the aforesaid correlations and the integration of
%%\thetool's API with a popular web framework, such as Django. We intend to write
%%some basic test cases --unittests-- to demonstrate clear cut cases of strong
%%correlations between inputs and outputs. The fourth milestone, is to present our
%%experiences and lessons learned as well as interesting (and previously unknown)
%%unintentional cases of discrimination uncovered by \thetool.
