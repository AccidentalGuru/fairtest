* Use training model in testing for Regression
    => Think about effect size, p-values for this

* Try out permutation tests and bootstrap CIs for testing
    => Different corrections for FDR
    
* Look for image-net datasets with Race, Gender, Age, etc.

* Simplify the whole measure thing
    => Since we have one measure copy per node, we can store results
    => compute(): store results
    => absolute effect: re-use result
    => FDR: update measure attributes?
