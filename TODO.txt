* Look for image-net datasets with Race, Gender, Age, etc.

* Dataset: Set protected attributes list (with type, and measure?)
* Run Experiment:
    - load data
    for PA in PAs:
        - encode data
        - train tree
        - get clusters
        - store (PA, cluster list)
    
    - get CIs for all PAs
    - correct p-values for all PAs
    - display results for all PAs (filename+_PA_TARGET)
