\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce the notion of Fairness in a data driven world. Refer again to the case mentioned
    in paragraph two (Staples case in detail). Then give specific examples with numbers and tables
    to simulate discrimination an underline lack (or not) of fairness.
  \item Analyze the tables and introduce the notion of statistical parity.
  \item Foreshadow the notion of business necessity.
  \item Introduce an example with business necessity (requirement).
  \item Analyze the example based only on statistical parity.
  \item Contradict and introduce business necessity.
  \item In addition to statistical parity, analyze also considering
    business necessity.
  \item Foreshadow natural inclination/utility function.
  \item Adreess that we limit our scope without adressing system utility; we leave it for future work.
\end{itemize}
