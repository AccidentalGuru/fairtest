\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sect:conclusion}
We have theoretically formalized the notion of discriminatory treatment of
users in modern data-driven web applications.  Also, we have designed,
implemented, and evaluated \sysname, a tool to increase developersâ€™ visibility
into the implications of various data-use policies by reporting discriminatory
treatment of users -- or, {\em privacy bugs}. Our results showed that \sysname
can uncover and measure the impact of {\em privacy bugs}
in pricing policies similar to the policy of ``Staples Inc.'' online store.

In the future we plan to explore the potential of using \sysname to evaluate
the presence of {\em privacy bugs} on real applications -- such as applications
used for online recommendations and advertising. Also, we plan to evaluate
\sysname's effectiveness in uncovering {\em privacy bugs} with the use of
ranking heuristics, other than {\em statistical parity}.
