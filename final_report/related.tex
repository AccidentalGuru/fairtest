%Fairness in the use of data by web applications is drawing increasing
%attention in our days, and yet there is no established methodology for
%measuring fairness of online algorithms producing recommendations, nor is
%there an established methodology for shading some light and helping
%uncover potential online discrimination cases. The authors of~\cite{Fairness}
%study fairness of classification and their purpose is to prevent
%discriminating individuals based on certain characteristics, such as
%membership in a group, and at the same time maintain the effectiveness of
%the classifier. The limitation of their approach is that it requires
%programmes to be able to define similarity metrics, and it is unclear
%whether programmers are able to define such metrics or not. Also,
\cite{DisparateImpact}
%unequal treatment of different populations
%by a classification methodology is studied for its legal concept of
%disparate impact. This work formalizes what it means for a dataset to
%have the potential for disparate impact if used by a classifier, and
%suggests methods for detecting and removing potential disparate impact.
%However, it is not showing the effectiveness of the proposed procedures
%in real applications, and also does not extend to general discrimination
%hazards.
