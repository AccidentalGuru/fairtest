Modern web applications are increasingly data driven and assist users
with their every-day tasks, ranging from browsing social networks to
issuing bank transactions. Users are accessing these applications from
various personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, and desktop PCs,
and always expect a highly personalized experience. Therefore, modern
applications are now metamorphosing the internet from an unbiased, impersonal
service into a highly personalized service that dynamically reforms to match
each individual's preferences. This personalized versioning of the internet
is based on the collection and processing of users' data that aid profiling
of individuals and infering matching preferences.
